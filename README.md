Odin Foundations 


Still working through the Odin Project.  I am 75% of the way through.  While I already know a lot of these concepts it is good to brush up on some techniques and to go through a structured self-guided curriculm.  

For this project I will be building a simple program to play a game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.
