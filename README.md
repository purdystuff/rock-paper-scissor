Odin Foundations 


Still working through the Odin Project.  I am 75% of the way through.  While I already know a lot of these concepts it is good to brush up on some techniques and to go through a structured self-guided curriculm.  

For this project I will be building a simple program to play a game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. 

Built from scratch.  I know that there is a better way to check the winner but I have thought of it yet.  At the moment it is a long stretch of if/else statements. Maybe using a ternary or switch would make it look at bit cleaner.
